# 0x03. C - Debugging
## Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

0-main.c, main.h - You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.  
1-main.c - Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.  
2-largest_number.c, main.h - Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.  
3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h - Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
