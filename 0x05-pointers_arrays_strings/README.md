#0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
##This repo has a list of c programs that explore basic concepts arround working with arrays, pointers, and other data structure, with a focus on pointers and memory allocation.  

0 - takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.  
1 - swaps the values of two integers.  
2 - returns the length of a string.  
3 - prints a strign, to stdout.  
4 - prints a string, int reverse.  
5 - reverses a strign.  
6 - prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.  
7 - prints half of a string.  
8 - prints n elements of an array of integers.  
9 - copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
